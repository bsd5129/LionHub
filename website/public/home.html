        <h2>Our Goal</h2>      
        <p class="lead">LionHub is a tool which brings together everything a new student needs to be successful.  College can be overwhelming, especially for students leaving home for the first time.  There is so much information located in so many different places that it can be hard to keep track of everything.  Our goal is to provide students with a central location that can direct them to everything they need to succeed.</p>
